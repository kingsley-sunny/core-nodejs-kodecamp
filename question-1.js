`A. **REFACTOR PATTERN **:

The Reactor Pattern is a design pattern used for handling asynchronous I/O operations in a non-blocking manner. It's a fundamental concept behind many event-driven frameworks in Node.js. In this pattern, a single event loop is responsible for dispatching events or requests to appropriate handlers when they become ready.

Node.js itself is built on the reactor pattern. Here's a simplified example:`;

const fs = require("fs");

// Asynchronous file read operation using the reactor pattern
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});

console.log("Reading file...");

`In this example, when "fs.readFile" is called, Node.js doesn't block the entire program. Instead, it registers a callback function to be executed when the file read operation is complete. Meanwhile, the program continues executing other code, like the 'console.log('Reading file...')' statement. When the file read is finished, Node.js invokes the provided callback function.``B. **CALLBACK PATTERN **:

The Callback Pattern is a way to work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It involves passing a function (the "callback") as an argument to another function. The callback is then executed when the operation is completed.

Here's an example using callbacks in Node.js:`;

function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Hello, world!";
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

function process(data) {
  console.log(`Received data: ${data}`);
}

fetchData(process);

`In this example, 'fetchData' is an asynchronous function that simulates fetching data. It takes a callback function 'process' as an argument. After two seconds, it invokes the 'process' function with the fetched data.






C. **THE MODULE SYSTEM **:

Node.js uses a module system to organize code into reusable and maintainable pieces. Each module can be a file containing JavaScript code. Modules can export functions, objects, or variables for use in other parts of your application.

Here's a simple example of creating and using modules in Node.js:`;

// math.js - a module exporting a simple add function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = {
  add,
};

// main.js - using the math module
const math = require("./math");

const result = math.add(5, 3);
console.log(`Result: ${result}`);

`In this example, 'math.js' is a module that exports the 'add' function. In 'main.js', we use "require" to import the "math" module and then call the "add" function.

Node.js provides a powerful module system that allows you to structure your codebase effectively, reuse code, and manage dependencies efficiently.`;
